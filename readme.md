Project 2: React
Overview

Project Description: I would like to build a chatroom application using React and an API called Scaledrone(https://www.scaledrone.com/docs/api-clients/javascript). This chatroom will update in real time and can have up to 10 concurrent users. Images, text, giphs can all be sent through chat.

In lieu of sample data I have attached a screenshot of the creation of an application channel for messaging that I initialized in Scaledrone.
